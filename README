N900 scripts to configure PM features

Copy the scripts/openrc/n900-pm to /etc/init.d/n900-pm and start
it manually with:

# /etc/init.d/n900-pm start

And if happy you can enable it on boot with:

# openrc add n900-pm default

To check the power management status periodically, you can do:

# /etc/init.d/n900-pm status
